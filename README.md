### Kon'nichiwa ppl 🥰

I am a developer who started coding when I was 11 years old.
I started with visual basic at school! (I was supposed to learn it by 14 years old tho), but I like trying stuff and I was in a good relationship with my IT teacher so yeah.

My IT teacher thought I was so good at it, so He invited me to join a nationwide coding competition!
Since we were only 11 years old, The competition wasn't that hard (for me rn xD). They wanted us to know the basics.
like data type, functions etc.
But I went through the databases and classes, then my teacher said I should keep up with coding, I love u (the best teacher ever! 🥰 No homo)
I got #2 on my nation lol, I believe the mistake was when I forgot to send an alert when the user types a wrong password xD, Kinda dumb ik.

Tho after that the "Paltel Group" contacted my dad since I got #2 and asked him to let me apply for something called "Code for Palestine" made by them.
I applied and passed their exams then I got accepted, and my journey started by that time 💙
I spent 3 years learning coding there, I learnt "Python", "HTML", "CSS", "Javascript","React-native", "React" (by order)
Then I learnt some languages/frameworks at home. So far I know the ones listed above and "Typescript (my fav)", "Flutter", "Php", "Laravel", "Angular", "C#", "C++"
And planning to learn "Java" and "C" After getting done with school.
I'm glad I've met a lot of people because of my teacher in the first place, really created my future! ❤
Thank you all the 998 contributions in the last year! for private and public projects as well.
Most of my projects are private, maybe 40 idk
But I started creating public projects maybe 2 months ago, and creating node packages as well😄.
My dreams is to get into a popular company such as Discord or Google, or a gaming company like Mihoyo who built Genshin Impact (all of them are kinda hard or mostly impossible xD, but yeah I'mma finish school then work harder on this).

wondering how old am I rn? well, I'll be 18 on Nov 29th 2021.
if you ever wanted to contact me then feel free to do!
my instagram is "aze.sama" without the qoutes ofc
